hey weni-
i'm trying to decide if those categories names are too cheesy, 
new-age-y, or something.  can i wither till tomorrow?  
as for bkgd and text color, i did come up with some that seemed pretty 
close:  ffffcc for the bkgd (just barely off white) and 996633 for the 
text.
don't worry about the coffee image for now, unless you need more.  i 
was 
trying to use some restraint and only send the 12 that you thought 
would 
be a jumping off point.  (or will we be able to add more, for the still 
part?)  my poor little brain...  
thanks!
